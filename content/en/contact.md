I can be found on my [IRC server](https://web.archive.org/web/20220521154901/https://irc.concealed.world/) fairly reliably in UTC afternoons and evenings. You can also reach me by e-mail on nixx @ firemail.cc - I'd prefer you use my [public key](https://web.archive.org/web/20220521154901/https://concealed.world/dwn/pubkey.asc) if possible.

I don't bite (unless you want me to).
