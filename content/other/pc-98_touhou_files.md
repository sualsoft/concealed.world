title: PC-98 Touhou Files
---

The source I once used to obtain these files went down, so I thought I'd host them myself. There are other sources, but they're less convenient.

As the PC-9800 series is obsolete, these games can be considered abandonware.

NB: These games were created by Team Shanghai Alice/ZUN, and do not belong to me. I'm working with the assumption that the developer wouldn't mind, considering the circumstances.
